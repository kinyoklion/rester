# Rester

A Rust application for testing and developing rest APIs.

# Getting Started

If you have cargo installed you can install it from [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rester).
```shell
cargo install rester
```

# Building from source

You will need a rust toolchain. I recommend installing using [rustup] https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

```shell
# To build
cargo build

# To run
cargo run

# To install
cargo install
```
